## Overview  
**Mission GPT** is an advanced, interactive document retrieval solution designed to streamline the process of extracting precise information from mission-critical documents. The project leverages cutting-edge **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, integrated with **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, and is optimized for a secure and user-friendly experience.

This project is built upon the [Private GPT](https://github.com/zylon-ai/private-gpt) framework with several customizations and enhancements tailored to the requirements of **ISRO's MSSG Department**.

## Features  

### Unique Enhancements by Me:
1. **User Authentication System**  
   - Developed a secure login and registration system using **Flask**.  
   - Implemented email-based authentication to ensure only authorized users can access the application.  

2. **Thematic UI Enhancements**  
   - Redesigned the **Gradio interface** to reflect the official **ISRO theme**, ensuring it aligns with the organization's branding.  

3. **Automatic File Management**  
   - Customized the backend to automatically delete ingested files after they are successfully added to their respective sections.  
   - Helps maintain a clean and secure environment for document processing.  

4. **Integration with Advanced LLMs**  
   - Incorporated **Mistral 7B** models and enhanced them further using **Ollama** for improved accuracy and efficiency in retrieving mission-critical data.  

5. **Improved Document Ingestion Process**  
   - Optimized the ingestion process for local documents to handle mission files with improved speed and scalability.  

6. **ISRO-Specific Use Case Customizations**  
   - Tailored the solution specifically for ISROâ€™s MSSG department to assist in retrieving insights from mission documents with precision.
