## Overview  
**Mission GPT** is an advanced, interactive document retrieval solution designed to streamline the process of extracting precise information from mission-critical documents. The project leverages cutting-edge **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, integrated with **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, and is optimized for a secure and user-friendly experience.

This project is built upon the [Private GPT](https://github.com/zylon-ai/private-gpt) framework with several customizations and enhancements tailored to the requirements of **ISRO's MSSG Department**.

## Features  

### Unique Enhancements by Me:
1. **User Authentication System**  
   - Developed a secure login and registration system using **Flask**.  
   - Implemented email-based authentication to ensure only authorized users can access the application.  

2. **Thematic UI Enhancements**  
   - Redesigned the **Gradio interface** to reflect the official **ISRO theme**, ensuring it aligns with the organization's branding.  

3. **Automatic File Management**  
   - Customized the backend to automatically delete ingested files after they are successfully added to their respective sections.  
   - Helps maintain a clean and secure environment for document processing.  

4. **Integration with Advanced LLMs**  
   - Incorporated **Mistral 7B** models and enhanced them further using **Ollama** for improved accuracy and efficiency in retrieving mission-critical data.  

5. **Improved Document Ingestion Process**  
   - Optimized the ingestion process for local documents to handle mission files with improved speed and scalability.  

6. **ISRO-Specific Use Case Customizations**  
   - Tailored the solution specifically for ISROâ€™s MSSG department to assist in retrieving insights from mission documents with precision.

# About PrivateGPT

**PrivateGPT** is a production-ready AI project that enables you to ask questions about your documents using the power of Large Language Models (LLMs), even without an internet connection. It ensures 100% privacy, with no data leaving your execution environment at any point.

The project provides an API offering all the required primitives to build private, context-aware AI applications. It follows and extends the OpenAI API standard, supporting both normal and streaming responses.

### API Overview

The API is divided into two logical blocks:

1. **High-level API**:  
   - **Ingestion of Documents**: Handles document parsing, splitting, metadata extraction, embedding generation, and storage.  
   - **Chat & Completions using Context from Ingested Documents**: Abstracts the retrieval of context, prompt engineering, and response generation.

2. **Low-level API**:  
   - **Embeddings Generation**: Generates embeddings from text.  
   - **Contextual Chunks Retrieval**: Given a query, returns the most relevant chunks of text from the ingested documents.

In addition, a working **Gradio UI client** is provided to test the API. It includes useful tools such as a bulk model download script, ingestion script, and documents folder watch, etc.

### Motivation Behind PrivateGPT

Generative AI is transformative, but industries like healthcare and legal are cautious about adopting AI tools due to privacy concerns. The risk of using third-party AI services that might not guarantee full data control is unacceptable for these sectors.

PrivateGPT addresses these concerns by allowing the use of LLMs in an offline environment, ensuring privacy and control over the data. It is a solution designed for privacy-sensitive environments.

---

### Primordial Version

The first version of PrivateGPT was launched in May 2023 as an educational tool to build fully local and private chatGPT-like solutions. This version quickly became a go-to solution for privacy-sensitive setups and laid the foundation for what PrivateGPT has become today.

If you wish to continue experimenting with the original version, it is available in the **primordial branch** of the project.

**Recommendation**: It is strongly advised to perform a clean clone and install of the latest version of PrivateGPT if you are transitioning from the primordial version.

---

### Present and Future of PrivateGPT

PrivateGPT is continuously evolving to become a gateway for generative AI models and primitives. These include completions, document ingestion, RAG pipelines, and other low-level building blocks. Our goal is to make it easier for developers to build AI applications while providing a robust architecture for the community to contribute to.

Stay tuned for updates and new features in upcoming releases.
